        <p>This object is a six month long project generated through natural evaporation. Originally a water cup used for painting, the object has become an index of the water's evaporation and the composition and properties of the paint remnants. The pattern of evaporation was largely dictated by the environment in which the container remained over the course of the waters evaporation. it's movement from a window sill to a box to eventually a desktop, is in some sense recorded in the residue collected on the inside of the container. The natural process of evaporation honestly and independently documents the artificial processes and circumstances the object underwent over six months.</p>
