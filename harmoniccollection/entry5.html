        <p>Retracing the Helvetica typeface creates a whole new form of material expression rooted in natural occurence. By giving myself a standard and geometric typeface as a template, I record my own tendencies and physicality in attempting to recreate it. All anomalies present in this new typeface represent my own natural characteristic removed from conscious manipulation. By basing expression in material fact and random chance occurance, I treat design as almost a science, attempting to document and discover instead of prescribing truth through design choices or symbolic reference.</p>
