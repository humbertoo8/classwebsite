        While digital formats hardly fit under the collection's "natural" label, one can observe it's mechanisms in the same way one may observe mechanisms of nature. Without delving too deep into an argument of transhumanism, the digital world and it's contraints have become part of our landscape, especially as artists and designers. The digital degradation of this word represent decay in the digital realm. As files are tranfered more and more, they degrade in quality as the file is compressed according to rules set by the file and the programs it enters. In this way, the file and it's content are manipulated in a larger interconnected system of factors.
