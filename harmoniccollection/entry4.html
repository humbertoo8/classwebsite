        <p>These are the hems of a couple of pairs of jeans of mine. They fit quite long so they drag on the ground when I walk. Because of this, they've recorded the many walk s I've had while wearing them. The jeans change in appearance every time I walk out and therefore, change in meaning over time. Jeans have long been a symbol of manual labor; of working class work ethic. The wear on your jeans both literally record and symbolically represent your physical experiences. For this reason, ripped and distressed jeans became a sign of virtue and experience. While they have now, with the advent of pre-distressed jeans, become complete simulacra of this, distressed jeans were once physical records of strife.</p>
