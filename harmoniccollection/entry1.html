        <p>While an artist largely holds control over the application and composition of materials, the materials themselves hold properties that largely determine the nature of these marks. I drew this line with compressed charcoal guided by a ruler on drawing paper. While I controlled the speed, pressure, and direction of the mark making, the exact pattern created by the charcoal on the paper was determined by many other systems of making. Considering the manufacturing procedures and even the physical properties of the manufactured natural resources, I ultimately played a relatively modest role in the creation of this simple line.</p>
