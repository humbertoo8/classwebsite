                <p>Both of these readings assigned this week set the groundwork for understanding the capabilities of the internet and coding as a whole in both practical and philosophical senses. The reading by Jorge Luis Borges, a narrative set well before the advent of the internet explores the concept of time and possibility. By decoding a narrative labryth written by an ancestor, the protagonist gains a better understanding of fate and the unlinearity of time. Much like this concept of multiple timelines, as interaction designers, we must anticipate the many paths a user may take through our programs. When coding our house assignment, we had to account for multiple paths one may take, and code for all of them. While each user may only choose a single path through the house, many muktiple possible courses simultaneously exist.</p>
